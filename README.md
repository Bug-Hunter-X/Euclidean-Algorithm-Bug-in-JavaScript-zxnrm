# Euclidean Algorithm Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a JavaScript implementation of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The algorithm is implemented recursively, but it fails for certain input combinations because of an error in handling the base cases or recursive calls.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected algorithm.
